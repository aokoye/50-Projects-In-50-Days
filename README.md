# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Right now I have free access to this 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on O'Reilly's website through the university \(always check the resources your university's library has\) that I am getting a certificate in technical writing through. Once I realized this I decided I would make the most of my time and try to complete the series.

## Background
I am re-learning web development with the goal of being able to be employed a frontend developer. At the start of this \(March 13th, 2025\) I am comfortable with HTML and CSS but am newer to Javascript.

## Goals
* Have little to no trepidation with HTML and CSS \(within reason\).
* Become comfortable with Javascript.
* Be able to use skills that I learned from making these projects in future projects that I'm interested in making.
* Make changes to at least some of these projects so that they become more my own. I would put an approximate percentage but I don't know how many projects I'll be able to make substantive changes to.
