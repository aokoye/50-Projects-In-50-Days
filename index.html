            <p>50 Projects in 50 Days is a course that was developed by <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/">Brad Traversy</a> and <a href="https://www.florin-pop.com/">Florin Pop</a> which is available on multiple platforms. I accessed it via O'Reilly's learning platform (which I have access to via the university I'm taking a technical writing certificate course through) but it can also be found on Udemy and <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/50-Projects-In-50-Days">Traversy Media</a>.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is a collection of the projects that I created. I've included a short write up about what I learned when doing them and what techniques were used in building them.</p>

                <p class="experience">This was a really enjoyable first project for me to do. It was also the first time I had done anything in the DOM. Given how quickly this project was, it gives me hope that I'll be able to digest all 50 projects.</p>
